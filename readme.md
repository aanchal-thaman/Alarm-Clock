# Alarm-Clock
A digital alarm clock has been made which sets alarm by taking the time from user value. The time is entered in 24 hour format and is verified. When the time to wake up matches with the current time a message is printed and consecutive beep sounds can be heard as reminder for the alarm. The alarm also comes with a snooze function that plays the alarm again after a period of one minute set to default.
