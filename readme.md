# Alarm-Clock
A digital alarm clock has been made which sets alarm by taking the time from user value. When the time to wake up matches with the current time a message is printed and consecutive beep sounds can be heard as reminder for the alarm. The alarm also comes with a snooze function that plays the alarm again after a period of one minute set to default.
